## About this folder

This folder contains the input files you should use for testing the
homework. These files should not be included with your assignment. You
should make the assumption that the files will exist in the local
directory when the project is graded.

To make things simpler, modified versions of the sorting routines from
the book have been included in `sort.cpp`.

## Setup

An example of the type of discussion expected in `results.pdf` is given
for quickSort in `exampleResults.pdf`.

Make sure that you have the Debian `texlive` package installed.

## Usage

You can build the PDF document by typing

```
make
```

in the root of the repository. The file `exampleResults.pdf` is the
generated output.

Typing

```
make clean
```

will remove all generated files.
